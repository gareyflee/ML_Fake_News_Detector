Several Algorithms to detect fake news

News-Media-Reliability contains original code from paper

To run CS 289A code (all algorithms except the neural network), run python3 src/main.py
This will be a long simulation exhaustively searching hundreds of hyperparamter combinations and plotting many results

To run the neural network run nn.ipynb in Jupyter notebook.
This build a classifier for both bias and factuality on the best found hyperparameters and display learning curve plots.

To run orignal SVC code, run python3 News-Media_Reliability/classification.py
